A trip to Japan, the vacation that I have always dreamt of, the vacation that will definitely change my life. Yes, my perfect vacation are not the ones that I have been on but is yet to come. Japan has always been my ideal vacation destination, the soothing and calm environment, a technology driven country yet so peaceful in its way of living. And the sights are a relief to the sore eyes. A developed country yet so connected to its roots. From breakfast to dinner and to its ranging snacks, Japan is also an ideal destination for a foodie like me. Food of japan made by such complex ingredients still turning out to be such a simple dish has always grasped my attention. Travelling to the heart of the country at night with all the shinning neon lights with my closest friends, now that is an experience to live for. Visiting the beaches in the morning to hitting the road on our small bikes to travel all around, roaming everywhere and tasting every little treat that we find along the way all these are the experience that I want to stack up on my plate of life. Having a trip to japan will be my perfect vacation and a dream come true.
