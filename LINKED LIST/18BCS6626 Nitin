This is an average human
In a world full of 7 billion like me, do we hold any significance? A question people ask themselves everytime they go in retrospect. Even on the days they do their best, the numbers just end up putting them among the rest. Cartoons sold children the dream of being the "hero", however it was the reality of life, that put the human back to the ground only to make them realize how insignificant they. On the days they try to rise, either it is their inability that brings down or the system which pulls them down. When all the attempts have been buried into the dust, all one can do is think of how rotten the world is. But it is at this moment averages need to realize the impact they make when they stand together and decide to take on every obstacle, however just like usual this attempt fails and is buried to the ground. And at the end the average realises the biggest responsibility they will ever get is of driving someone from one location to another.
